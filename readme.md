# Weavetree

A fast, reproducible abstraction-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search engine written in Rust, with optional Python bindings.

## Todo

- weavetree-cli for toolchain purposes
- reproducibility
- abstraction algorithms (partitioning, bisimulation, approximate bisimulation)
- detailed logging and extraction during runs (add standardized outputs e.g. via JSON)
    - visualization on top
- concurrency during simulation for faster sims
- MCTS and uMCTS
